#What is a Linked List ? 
A Linked List is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.
Each node consists of a data and a pointer that points to the next node .

#The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation 
or reorganization of the entire structure.

#Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element have linear time complexity.

# The Linked List data Structure supports three main operations
  => Insertion : to add an element at the begining ,end or at a given index in the list.
  => Deletion  : to remove an item given its index or value.
  => Search    : to find an element given its value.

# Applications of linked lists.
 > Implementation of stacks and queues.
 > Implementation of Graphs.
 > Dynamic memory allocation.
 > 

 # Application in real world.
 > image viewer : Previous and next images are linked and can be accessed by the next and previous buttons.
 > Previous and next page in a web browser.
 > GPS navigation systems.
 > Image Processing.
