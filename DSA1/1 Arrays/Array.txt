#What is an Array ?
An array is a datastructure that stores collection of elements in a contigeous block of memory. 
and also it can hold a collection of values.

An array can contain a mix of different data types.You can store strings, booleans, numbers 
or even objects all in the same array

Arrays are resizable.You don't have to declare the size of an array before creating it 

Javascript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertion order maintained.

Arrays are iterables, they can be used with for of loops.
