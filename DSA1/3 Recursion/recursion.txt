RECURSION.

WHAT IS RECURSION ?
Ans : Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends
on solution to smaller instances of the same problem

Basically Recursion is when a function calls itself.

Why using Recursion ? 
Great technique to simplify the solution.
if you find yourself breakdown your problem into smaller versions of the 
same problem, recursion is very useful.

NOTE : Every recursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to 
                                                            to terminate the recursoin.
